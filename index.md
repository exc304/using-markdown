# Task Lists
**What is a task list?** A task list creates checkboxes to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests. If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render.
### Basics of a task list
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
### My task list
- [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Outline my portfolio
- [ ] Introduce myself to the world

Remember, a task list starts with the syntax `- [ ] ` and then the task list item. The formatting is specific!
